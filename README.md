👋 A technology enthusiast transitioning careers, seeking my first opportunity as a junior developer.

🎓 Graduated in Biology from USP and currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at UNIVESP, I'm determined to merge my passion for science and technology to create innovative solutions.

💼 Currently doing an intership at Caterpillar INC, where I'm immersed in the world of software development, learning and contributing to challenging projects.

🕹️ In my leisure time, you'll likely find me exploring the world of Diablo II or any ARPG or binge-watching movies and series.

🚀 I'm excited to collaborate on exciting projects, learn from a diverse community, and grow professionally as part of this exciting journey in technology. Let's create something amazing together!
